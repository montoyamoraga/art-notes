# art-notes

## About

art-notes is a list of art references and resources. It is a project by [Aarón Montoya-Moraga](http://montoyamoraga.io/).

Thanks to the people that have contributed to the project, including:

* [Caleb Ferguson](https://github.com/calebfergie)
* [Nicolás Peña-Escarpentier](https://github.com/nicolaspe/)
* [Paula Leonvendagar](https://github.com/paulaleonv)

## Statement

I am doing this because I always stumble upon beautiful art, and I want to share it, so that others can experience it too. It is also an exercise about being transparent and the politics and biases behind writing, indexing, privacy, identity, gender, open-source.

## Contact

If you have any comment, send an email to montoyamoraga@gmail.com in order to be deleted, or post an issue on this GitHub repository.
